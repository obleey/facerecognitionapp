# Facerecognition App

This is the final project for the ZTM course:
The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery. This is the Frontend part of the project. Made using Hooks (this was fun to code along with hooks, since the course project was developed using Classes).

**Installation:**
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

**Libraries/framework used:**


[React](https://reactjs.org/)

[Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/)

All contributions are welcome. To contribute, simply `fork` the repo and do your magic.

Have fun :)))
